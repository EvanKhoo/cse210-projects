Encapsulation - Articulation

Explain the meaning of Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about encapsulating certain parts of a program and 
"protecting" or "hiding" that part of the program from other progam files or
parts to ensure their integrety and to make sure they are not changed or 
affected. The practice of encapsulation is used primarily to ensure that 
certain parts of programs do not unintentionally affect other parts that you
want or need to be untouched. This also makes code easier to work with as it
is less fragile, letting you work and program without fear that something 
else will break with your changes.

Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation

Encapsulation allows you to work uninhibited without fear of destroying, 
breaking or crashing your code later as certain sensitve parts are protected
making your overall code less fragile. 

Provide an application of Encapsulation

Say you have an entity with certain attributes. An elephant might have color,
age, and name as attributes. You want to be able to access the elephant class
and make new elephants and manipulate their attributes without destroying
the integreity of what the attributes represent. You can make those 
attributes private and offer controlled gates of control ensuring that they
can only be accessed through strict rules that ensure their integrity. 

Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote

An example of encapsulation that I used in my program is my _words attribute 
of my Word class. I wanted to take a string and put it into a list to 
manipulate the data inside without compromising the attribute itself. I made
the list private and made strict access requirements so that I would manipulate
the data in safe and predicatable ways.
